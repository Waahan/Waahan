I am an aspiring programmer and have interests in many different parts
of computer science. I love low-level programming, C++ is my favourite
language, and I know a fair bit of. I do a little bit of Java, Bash and
Python. I love my Linux desktop with either Arch or Gentoo. In the future
I would like to do more 3D graphics with Vulkan and OpenGL.
